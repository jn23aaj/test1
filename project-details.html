      <h3>Drift Racer</h3>
      <p>
        Drift Racer was a 4 person project done by me and 3 friends for a university assignment. The game is inspired by Mario Kart and other early 2000s
        racing games. We used C# and the Unity engine as Unity allowed us to make a quite in-depth game whilst remaining pretty simple to use. This was also my first
        project using C# so provided a useful learning opportunity for me as well. The game featured a small map that the user can drive their car around attempting
        to get the fastest time possible. Depending on the time achieved they could get a gold, silver, bronze or no medal at all. There was also a leaderboard to
        track the fastest times achieved. There was additional plans to add extra maps and cars to use. The different cars could be freely chosen between and
        specialise in different things, for example one car could have the highest top speed in the game, but it's acceleration could be lackluster compared to
        some of the others. Leaving it up to the player to choose which one they want depending on their style and the map they were playing. The different maps
        would each have their own theme with our first map having a hell/underworld theme, with half the track being an evil castle and the rest a cave through a
        lava filled landscape.
