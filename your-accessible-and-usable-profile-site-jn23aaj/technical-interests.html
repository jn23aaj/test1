      <h2>Artificial Intelligence and Software Development</h2>
      <p>
        I have a significant interest into the world of artifical intelligence within Computer Science.
        In recent years, AI has seen a massive surge in relevancy with the invention of chatGPT, Copilot and many more.
        Furthermore, growing up I would always play games against different AI characters in videogames that were coded to
        varying degrees of quality. These factors plus the many films about AI whether it was evil or not has made me very
        interested in artificial intelligence over the years and I would like to get involved in the field hopefully
        being involved myself in the creation of a highly advanced artificial intelligence that can be used to assist
        humans during their work, or create a lifelike mimic of a real player in a videogame.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a keen interest in software/videogame development. This stems from my childhood where I would play many games or use different apps.
        During my childhood, I always dreamed of making my own games based off one idea or another that I would get from my favourite games, and how I thought
        they could be improved. The idea of creating an application that could help someone through their life or for them to enjoy seems fun to me and always
        interested me, and hope that one day I can do just that.
